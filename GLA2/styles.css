Instructions
Create a design layout that is consistent proportional to window size
The image below shows the full-screen presentation of the layout.

The image below shows what happens when the screen’s width and height are adjusted in sync (width = height).

The image below shows what happens when the screen’s width increases more than its height (width > height).

The image below shows what happens when the screen’s height increases more than its width (height > width).

Overview
A CSS box model design layout is shown above. To construct the layout seen above, apply the relevant HTML elements and CSS attributes (using an external CSS file).
 You are provided with the HTML code. Your goal is to utilize a CSS stylesheet and style the HTML elements in a way that matches the aforementioned layout requirements.

Directions
1 - The HTML code is provided and can be used right away. - OK
2 - There is no need to change this file except to write your name in Square 3. - OK
3 - Do not use JavaScript code in this activity. - OK
4 - Create an external CSS stylesheet to style the HTML elements according to the following requirements. - OK
5 - All 3 elements should be square-shaped (width = height) at all times, regardless of the changes in window size - OK.
6 - The width of Square 2’s boundary should be double that of Square 1’s boundary. - OK
7 - The width of Square 3's boundary should be four times that of Square 1's boundary. - OK
8 - The corners of the square boxes should always meet. - OK
9 - Style the elements to match the four images described above. - BORDER?
10 - Full-screen layout
    Screen width = screen height

    Used the following formula to define sizes:
    1x + 2x + 4x = 100
    7x = 100
    x = 100/7
    x = 14.29
